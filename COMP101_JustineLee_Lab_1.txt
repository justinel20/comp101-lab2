LAB 2 QUESTION:
You have created a GitHub repository and want to share it with your friend Bob by
sending him the repository link. When Bob clicks the link in his web browser, some
communication happens over the internet. Explain step by step what happens using the
concepts of client and server. In your explanation, make sure to mention:

• Which device acts as the client

• Which device acts as the server 

• How Bob’s browser requests the repository content

• How the server responds and sends the content back to Bob

Bob's web browser acts as the client to the GitHub servers when he requests the repository content, the link, and send the information wia wireless connection to Bob's screen.
